**Project Status: Under Development**

---

## 🧠 Overview
This assistant leverages real-time computer vision and NLP to guide users through changing a flat tire using an egocentric (chest-mounted) camera.  

It detects tools, tracks task progress, and provides interactive, step-by-step visual and voice instructions for changing a vehicle tire.

---

## 🚀 System Features
- **Real-Time Tool Detection**  
  Identifies car jack, wheel wrench, spare tire, and more using YOLOv8.

- **Action Recognition**  
  Tracks the task progression: loosening bolts, jacking the car, removing the tire, etc.

- **Voice Assistant**  
  Responds to voice queries like “What’s next?” using speech recognition and TTS.

- **Edge-Friendly Pipeline**  
  Designed for mobile or embedded deployment with minimal latency.

## 🎥 Dataset

### 📹 Data Collection Methodology
- **Primary Source**  
  Self-collected footage of two tire changes on a *Renault Megane 2*, recorded using Samsung A50 smartphones from chest-mounted perspectives.

- **Secondary Source**  
  Curated YouTube videos demonstrating tire changes on various vehicle types.

- **Annotation**  
  Manual labeling of action segments and bounding boxes for object detection.

### 📁 Dataset Structure

## 💻 Usage

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Intelligent-Assistant-for-Tire-Change.git
cd Intelligent-Assistant-for-Tire-Change
```

### 2. Create and Activate Virtual Environment (Recommended)
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate      # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 3. Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Run the System
Run action recognition or object detection modules as follows (example):
```bash
python action_recognition/infer.py      # For recognizing user actions
python object_detection/detect.py       # For detecting tools in real-time
```

> ⚠️ Make sure to update paths to your video or webcam stream, and provide access to model weights.
